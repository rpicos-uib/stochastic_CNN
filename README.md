# stochastic_CNN
Implementation of a Cellular Nonlinear Network using stochastic computing and memristors, applied to image processing. The code is an implementation of the procedure described in our paper "Camps, O.; Al Chawa, M.M.; Stavrinides, S.G.; Picos, R. Stochastic Computing Emulation of Memristor Cellular Nonlinear Networks. Micromachines 2022, 13, 67. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi13010067", so please cite it if (when :D ) you use it.

Run the "readImag.m" in the mat/ directory to process gray images in the figs/ directory (set the paths correctly!) or the "readImag_color.m" to process RGB images. The values of the genii are specified inside the code, and also in the original paper.
